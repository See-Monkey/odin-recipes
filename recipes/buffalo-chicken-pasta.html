    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large boneless skinless chicken breast, <em>equal to 1 lb</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup ranch dressing, <em>can sub blue cheese</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup yellow onion, <em>diced</em></li>
        <li>1 stick celery, <em>diced</em></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>14.5 oz diced tomatoes, <em>undrained (1 can)</em></li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 lb penne</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buffalo sauce</li>
        <li>8 oz cream cheese, <em>softened and cubed</em></li>
        <li>1.5 cups cheddar, <em>shredded</em></li>
        <li>1 cup mozarella</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes, <em>optional</em></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cold butter, <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place <strong>chicken</strong> in a pot of water and bring to a gentle boil. (A gentle boil
            ensures that the chicken doesn’t become tough.) Cook for 15 minutes, until cooked through. 
            Remove and use two forks to shred. Toss with <strong>ranch</strong> dressing and set aside.</li>

        <li>Melt <strong>butter</strong> in a large high-walled skillet over medium heat. Add the 
            <strong>onions</strong> and <strong>celery</strong>. Cook for 5 minutes, until softened. 
            Add the <strong>garlic</strong> and cook for 1 more minute.</li>

        <li>Add the <strong>undrained diced tomatoes</strong> and <strong>chicken broth</strong>. Bring to 
            a boil and add the <strong>pasta</strong>. Submerge the pasta into the liquid and let it come 
            back up to a boil.</li>

        <li>Cover and let it boil for 10-13 minutes, or until al dente. Don't cook any more than al dente 
            as we will be keeping it over low heat until the sauce is thickened. Lift the lid and run a 
            silicone spatula underneath the pasta a few times throughout cooking to ensure it doesn't stick. 
            Test a pasta noodle for doneness before proceeding.</li>

        <li>Reduce heat to low. Add the <strong>buffalo sauce, cubed cream cheese, and shredded cheese</strong>. 
            Use a silicone spatula to gently stir. The sauce will seem thin at first, but it continues to 
            thicken as it stands, and will thicken further at the next step.</li>

        <li>Add the <strong>shredded chicken</strong> and <strong>red pepper flakes</strong>.</li>

        <li>Optional: Once sauce is near your desired consistency, swirl in 2 tablespoons 
            <strong>cold butter</strong>. This is a technique that chefs use called “Monter au Beurre”, which 
            creates a smooth finish when added to warm sauces.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Use slightly less than a pound of pasta if you like extra sauce. It will take a little longer to 
            thicken up but this is preferable if you plan on having leftovers, as the pasta will absorb more 
            sauce in the fridge.</li>

        <li>Make sure the cream cheese is fully softened when you add it to the pasta to ensure it melts well.</li>

        <li>Boil the chicken <em>gently</em> to ensure it doesn't become tough.</li>

        <li>Shred the cheese from a block for extra creamy results. Bagged shredded cheese doesn't melt (or 
            taste) as good.</li>

        <li>Add the cheese to the sauce over <em>low</em> heat. If the heat is too high, the dairy will separate and 
            the consistency will become grainy.</li>

        <li>Blue cheese can be used instead of ranch if preferred</li>
    </ul>
