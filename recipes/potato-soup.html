    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>6 strips uncooked bacon, <em>cut into small pieces</em></li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, <em>unsalted or salted</em></li>
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, <em>chopped</em></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, <em>minced</em></li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2.5 lbs gold potatoes, <em>peeled and diced</em></li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1.5 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon anch chile powder</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>shredded cheddar cheese, <em>topping (optional)</em></li>
        <li>fresh chives, <em>topping, (optional)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place <strong>bacon</strong> pieces in a large Dutch Oven or soup pot over medium 
            heat and cook until crisp and browned.</li>

        <li>Remove bacon pieces and set aside, leaving the fat in the pot.</li>

        <li>Add <strong>butter</strong> and <strong>chopped onion</strong> and cook over 
            medium heat until onions are tender (3-5 minutes).</li>

        <li>Add <strong>garlic</strong> and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).</li>

        <li>Sprinkle the <strong>flour</strong> over the ingredients in the pot and stir until 
            smooth (use whisk if needed).</li>

        <li>Add <strong>diced potatoes</strong> to the pot along with <strong>chicken broth, 
            milk, heavy cream, salt, pepper</strong>, and <strong>ancho chili powder</strong>. 
            Stir well.</li>

        <li>Bring to a boil and cook until potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork (about 
            10 minutes).</li>

        <li>Reduce heat to simmer and remove approximately half of the soup to a blender (be 
            careful, it will be hot!) and puree until smooth (half is about 5 cups of soup, 
            but just eyeballing the amount will be fine. Alternatively you can use an immersion 
            blender.).</li>

        <li>Return the pureed soup to the pot and add <strong>sour cream</strong> and reserved 
            <strong>bacon pieces</strong>, stir well.</li>

        <li>Allow soup to simmer for 15 minutes before serving. Top with additional <strong>sour 
            cream, bacon, cheddar cheese</strong>, or <strong>chives</strong>. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Start with a more reserved amount of salt and then add more as needed; the amount of 
            salt needed will vary depending on the type/brand of broth you use</li>

        <li>If you haven't used ancho chili powder before, I recommend starting with 1/4 teaspoon 
            and then taste-testing before increasing to 1/2 teaspoon if you like the taste.</li>
    </ul>
