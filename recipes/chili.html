        <li>3 tablespoons fresh cilantro, <em>chopped</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Heat <strong>oil</strong> in a large pot over medium heat; 
            cook and stir <strong>onion, bell pepper, Anaheim pepper, jalapeno peppers</strong>, 
            and <strong>garlic</strong> in the hot oil until softened.</li>

        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir <strong>beef</strong> 
            in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add <strong>Worcestershire sauce</strong> and <strong>garlic powder</strong>. Crumble 
            <strong>bouillon cubes</strong> over beef and add <strong>beer</strong>. Continue to cook, 
            scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, until liquid is hot, about 
            3 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir beef mixture into pepper mixture.</li>

        <li>Stir <strong>crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, tomato paste</strong>, and 
            <strong>wine</strong> to the beef mixture. Season with <strong>chili powder, 2 tablespoons 
            cumin, brown sugar, pepper sauce, basil, paprika, salt, oregano</strong>, and <strong>black 
            pepper</strong>.</li>

        <li>Bring to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Cover and simmer until meat and vegetables 
            are very tender and flavors have developed in the chili, about 90 minutes, stirring 
            occasionally.</li>

        <li>Mix <strong>kidney beans</strong> into beef and vegetables. Continue to simmer until beans 
            are hot, about 30 minutes more.</li>

        <li>Blend <storng>sour cream, cilantro</storng>, and remaining <strong>1/2 teaspoon cumin</strong> 
            in a food processor until smooth. Serve sour cream mixture with chili.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>If you don't have time to simmer your chili for hours, you can thicken it with cornmeal, 
            cornstarch, or all-purpose flour. Add 1 tablespoon of cornmeal directly to the pot and allow 
            it to simmer for about 10 more minutes to thicken up. Or add a cornstarch or flour slurry â€” 
            this means 1 tablespoon of water mixed with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch or 2 tablespoons of 
            water mixed with 1 tablespoon of flour. If you add flour or cornstarch directly to the chili, 
            it will clump. Instead, gradually whisk in the slurry then simmer for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Package completely-cooled chili into an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator 
            for up to four days.</li>

        <li>If you want your chili to last longer, you should freeze it. Ladle completely cooled individual 
            servings of chili into zip-top freezer bags (make sure to squeeze out the excess air). Label 
            and date the bags, and store them in the freezer for up to three months.</li>
    </ul>
